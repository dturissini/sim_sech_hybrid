D+ with freqs (eq 2 Fang et al)
Use mel as ancestral allele

How to get mel alleles as outgroup
  1) map mel reads to sim genome and merge with vcf?
    easier to process vcf
    but could lead to mapping errors and genotype calls
    would I want to map multiple mel lines?
  2) liftover from hal file?
    harder to process vcf 
      need independent mel allele lookup
      how to handle mel freqs?
        just assume it's fixed?
    
    could recode vcf by mel as ancestral allele
      add dummy ancestor to vcf for outgroup
        use as lookup to determine if vcf alleles (based onm sim ref) is ancestral or need to be flipped to get ancestral/derived alleles
        filter out any sites that become trialleleic with mel
          write to log for future reference if needed


record and display difference between two site patterns (ABBA-BABA) and (ABAA - BAAA)
  as well as D+
  
distribution of denominator helpful for detemrining window size for D+

Look for ILS enrichment across genome
  expect neutral ILS to be uniformly distributed
  comparing ILS and D+ distributions across genomes
  involves looking at all 8 site pattern
  looking where gene tree and species trees are discordant
  look into Trails program


look into Twist program (https://github.com/simonhmartin/twisst)
  paint chromosome by weighted topologies
  weights tree topologies
  


Aside from introgression, use mel alleles to better categorize gwas snps?


Hypothesized demographic history:
  lots of ancestral variation lead to a ton of ILS in simulans clade
  most introgression from sech into sim was old (small tracts)
  introgression involved a lot of ancestral alleles
  small populations of sech and ssh in Seychelles lead to a lot of drift and fixation
  enough time has passed for some reproductive isolation with cosmopolitan sim 
  

Could sim_sech_hybrids just be independent evolution of octanoic acid resistance in Seychelles simulans?
  Or even if there was historic introgression, did OA resistance still evolve independently?



Remake filtered vcf with much lower maf threshold
  redo pca

    can call sym vs nonsym using gff and vcf
